Last night I went to the [Varsity Theater](http://varsitytheater.org/) to see one of my favorite bands - [Motion City Soundtrack](http://motioncitysoundtrack.com/). They were celebrating the ten year anniversary of their critically acclaimed album "Commit This to Memory". As a music hobbyist who once had aspirations of "making it" I often wonder what makes one song / album / artist successful where others are not. Last night was no different.

Midway through the performance of the last song on the album, "Hold Me Down", I looked around and saw a thousand people singing in unison and covered in confetti. In that exact moment none of them cared about anything other than the experience right in front of their face. Bills were forgotten. Youth was rediscovered. Time was suspended. And everyone had looked up from their phones to pay attention to five humans making beautiful noise and being genuine.

The world needs more experiences like this.
