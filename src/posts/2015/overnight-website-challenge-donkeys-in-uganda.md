Each year, the Nerdery [Overnight Website Challenge](http://www.overnightwebsitechallenge.com/) introduces me to a new non-profit that needs serious technical help. This year, that non-profit was [Child Reach Uganda](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Child-Reach-Uganda/313509207941). And boy did they need help.

You see, Child Reach Uganda is pretty much one person. Diane Kroska. And she's amazing. But she is not a technical person. She spends her time traveling to Uganda and supporting small villages there. She focuses her effort on working with American primary school students to offer humanitarian aid to impoverished families. And she's making an impact. Both in Uganda and on the students who are contributing.

When we entered the challenge last weekend, I was both thrilled and a bit terrified to work with a non-profit that had nothing. No logo. No website. No content.

As the day got moving and discussions started with Diane, I began to draw parallels between her work in Uganda and my work on her shiny new website. I was doing humanitarian work here. There was no need for tools that required deep technical knowledge. It would be as pointless as Diane giving someone in Uganda a Ferrari. 

So I focused on the content. In fact, I spent the first 4-5 hours of the challenge looking through over 4000 photos on various thumb drives and CDs. And the longer I looked, the more I felt like I had been there and needed to help. It gave me a sense of great pride that propelled me through the night and kept me motivated.

But you see, helping the people of Uganda in a mere 24 hours is not an easy task. Almost impossible. So [Team Donkeys](http://tc2015.overnightwebsitechallenge.com/teams/195) instead chose to help Diane and ensure she had the tools she needed to amplify her efforts. 

Next time you find yourself working on a project, no matter how big or small, think about what you're doing to amplify the efforts of your client instead of worrying about which hot new framework to use. Does a client really care about using specific technologies and tools like <s>REDACTED</s> or <s>REDACTED</s>? No. They care about impact.
