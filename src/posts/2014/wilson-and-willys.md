I've spent the past couple of months helping out some new friends stand up a new website for their passion project, [Wilson and Willy's](http://wilsonandwillys.com/). As simply as I can put it, Wilson and Willy's believes in finding quality American manufacturers and providing you access to their goods.

Besides the online store, Wilson and Willy's will be opening a physical location in the warehouse district of downtown Minneapolis this winter. I'd highly recommend swinging by to the check out the quality craftsmanship in person. And while you're down there swing by [Moose and Sadie's](http://www.mooseandsadies.com/) for local eats and an americano.

Now on to the tech details! This site is built on top of [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) and is a partially customized theme. It was my first chance to work with Shopify in close to two years and I was very pleased to see some of the updates they've made recently, especially the responsive checkout and addition of support for SASS.

After this experience, I'm definitely looking forward to working with Shopify again in the future.
